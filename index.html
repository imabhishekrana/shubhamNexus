                <p class="sectionsubtag textsmallp">Telescopes have a particular range of light that they can detect. Hubble’s domain extends from the ultraviolet through the visible (which our eyes see) and into the near-infrared. This range has allowed Hubble to deliver stunning images
                    of stars, galaxies, and other astronomical objects that have inspired people around the world and changed our understanding of the universe. Hubble has made more than 1.4 million observations over the course of its lifetime. Over 18,000
                    peer-reviewed science papers have been published on its discoveries, and every current astronomy textbook includes contributions from the observatory. The telescope has tracked interstellar objects as they soared through our solar
                    system, watched a comet collide with Jupiter, and discovered moons around Pluto. It has found dusty disks and stellar nurseries throughout the Milky Way that may one day become fully fledged planetary systems and studied the atmospheres
                    of planets that orbit other stars. Hubble has peered back into our universe’s distant past, to locations more than 13.4 billion light-years from Earth, capturing galaxies merging, probing the supermassive black holes that lurk in their
                    depths, and helping us better understand the history of the expanding universe. In its over 30 years of operation, Hubble has made observations that have captured humanity’s imaginations and deepened our knowledge of the cosmos. It
                    will continue to do so for years to come.

                    Hubble has helped answer some of the most compelling astronomical questions of our time, and revealed enigmas that we never knew existed. Throughout history, humanity’s eyes on the universe have never seen with more clarity or focus;

                    of engineers, scientists, and operators at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center work together to monitor Hubble as it travels around Earth, point the telescope at cosmic targets, and solve any problems that arise. They perform their
                    work in specialized facilities that provide the tools and equipment needed to operate this great observatory and continue its legacy of success.
